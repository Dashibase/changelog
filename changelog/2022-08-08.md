## New Dashibase preview and testing

After two weeks of long, long days, we are finally ready to share an early preview of the new Dashibase! It took a little longer than we had hoped but here we are. Thank you for your patience!

With the new Dashibase, you can:

- Connect multiple databases and set granular table- and column-level access (aka data resources)
- Build modern CRUD dashboards through a Notion-like interface (powered by [Lotion](https://github.com/dashibase/lotion))
- Share use or edit accesses to your dashboards and data resources to your teammates

We are giving access to the new Dashibase to community members in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/rUw2snFeUZ) first. Join the community if you would like to skip the waitlist.  

Quick word of caution: Do expect some bugs. We do not recommend trying our preview version on your production databases. Or yolo! (No, just kidding. Please don't.)
