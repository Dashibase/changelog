## Dashibase now availabe in open beta

After about a month of testing with our community, fixing issues, and improving the experience, we are finally ready to share our beta with the public!

### Create beautiful internal CRUD dashboards in minutes

Dashibase allows you to create modern-looking internal CRUD dashboards on top of your databases, using a Notion-like UI. Features such as slash command and markdown formatting let you quickly build your dashboards without dragging and dropping components repeatedly. 

Other features include:

- Control what tables and columns in your databases can be read and edited by the rest of your team
- Select and display your data by editing your table via a GUI (instead of writing SQL)
- Get a single-item view of each item on your tables automatically
- Add context and instructions alongside your tables
- Share dashboard access with your team

### Pricing

Most of the features in Dashibase are available for free. On the free plan, all dashboards are editable by everyone in the organization and you cannot set granular data access restrictions for your databases.

Advanced features such as user permissions for dashboards and granular data access control are only available on the paid planâ€”currently priced at $10/user/month for this first phase of the beta. 

### Upcoming improvements

In the coming weeks, we will be improving the CRUD experience specifically. Here are some of improvements on our todo list:

- Improve new dashboard page template
- Add a search box for each table
- Support nth-degree joins
- Allow updating joined inputs via a dropdown
- Support read-only and required for inputs

We are considering adding charts too. [Let us know](https://twitter.com/dashibase) how important charts are for you!
