## Miss Microsoft's Clippy?

Sadly, we are not adding [Clippy](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577468/microsoft-office-clippy-emoji-tweet-likes) to Dashibase. (I don't even think we can legally.) But we did add something to help you understand Dashibase faster: A demo dashboard (with a cute wizard).

At Dashibase, we are introducing new ways of doing things. In this case, building internal tools with a Notion-like interface. Even if people are familiar with Notion, building internal tools with a Notion-like interface might not feel natural. Our new onboarding wizard will guide you through how to add tables, reorder your blocks, and format your text.

Every new organization will now get a demo dashboard with dummy data so that you can get the hang of Dashibase and successfully set up your first dashboard as quickly as possible. 

If there's anything confusing in Dashibase, you can always reach us, founders, directly in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/crhDFYvbbq).

## Supabase Launch Week 5

We were invited to join Supabase's Launch Week 5 Community Day last week to share about Dashibase. As always, it was fun hanging out with the Supabase crew and the community. We wouldn't be here without your/their support.

If you are new to Dashibase, you can watch [my quick demo of Dashibase for the event](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-5-community-day). I would also recommend reading more about the Community Day and checking out other cool projects from the community on [the Supabase blog](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-5-community-day).

Shoutout to Bryan Klein (one of our earliest supporters) for joining us for the livestream and Kidron for grabbing the timestamped YouTube URL.
