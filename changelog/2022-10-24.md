## Dashibase loads way faster now

We use Dashibase ourselves for our internal admin panel because we believe using our own product will enable us to make it even better. One thing that has annoyed us for a while is how slow the app loads. Since we use Dashibase multiple times a day, the slowness gets quite annoying.

But no more. 

**Pages that took 1-3 seconds to load now take less than a second.** 

We just fixed a few latency issues so that the app loads way faster now. You will notice the difference when launching the app, switching organizations, and opening a detailed item view.

Check out this comparison:

We are also working on making tables load faster as some tables load slower than others. 

## A better way to view and edit JSON

We now format your JSON entries so that you can more easily read and update them.

- The new JSON input block automatically format your JSON entries. Just copy and paste a messy JSON file into the input block to see the magic.
- You can fold parts of your JSON entry using the toggle button on the left of the input block.
- Dashibase checks the validity of your JSON entry in real-time and warns you of any errors immediately.

## One-click copy

All input blocks now come with a copy button so that you can quickly copy the entry, especially long texts and JSON entries. 

## Improvements and fixes

- The width and height of textarea and other resizable elements will now persist after saving the dashboard
- Hitting 'Enter' after naming a dashboard now creates the dashboard immediately, speeding up the experience
- Added a quick survey to get feedback from users who chose not to connect their database
