## Refactoring and reflections

The theme of the week is refactoring and reflections.

While we have rapidly shipped several big-ticket updates and features in the past weeks, we have also incurred significant technical debt. We took this week to focus on general springcleaning and code hygiene, laying the foundation for future sprints.

We also consolidated our learnings from speaking to the dozens of users from our first round of onboarding calls - thank you for your time! These helped us refine our product direction and with that in mind, we have a few upcoming announcements that we are really hyped about. Stay tuned!

## Improvements and fixes

Improvements

- We now have documentation for Actions at [https://dashibase.com/docs](https://dashibase.com/docs).
- Data for joined attributes previously took over a second to load. They load instantly now.
- You no longer need to set your ID column for each of your pages because we now automatically get that information from your Supabase schema.
- Pagination in the dashboards is now a text input so that it's easier to skip to further pages. 
- We now use custom components for filter and sort in the dashboards, which look more modern and fixed some styling issues.
- The colors of tags have been improved. (Thanks, [Ben](https://www.supercreative.design/), for giving us the feedback that they looked like buttons!)

Bugs fixes

- The filter option in dashboards would break if you use `varchar` in Supabase. This has been fixed. (Thanks, Bryan, for bringing this up!)
- Some dashboards would not load if the dashboard metadata was cached before we added the "Actions" feature. We have fixed this. (Thanks, Joel, for bringing this up!)
- "Trigger" has been renamed to "Action" throughout the Dashibase app for clarity.
- We added internal versioning to dashboards so that local storage gets updated appropriately when we roll out feature updates.

If you notice any breaking bugs, feel free to ping us in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/dashibase-community/shared_invite/zt-180rycyqv-ifRwyiQAiXUlBBVxgxQE7g). Otherwise, it'll be awesome if you want to add them as issues to [our open source repo](https://github.com/Dashibase/dashibase/issues).
