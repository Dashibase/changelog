## View your Supabase data in beautiful tables

Dashibase View is a simple way to display your Supabase data in beautiful tables and safely share them with your team.

- View multiple tables on a single page
- Customize views with hide, filter, and sort
- Safely share read-only tables with a private URL
- Set a password to keep your view secure
- Get modern-looking tables without dealing with HTML & CSS
- Embed views on your website (coming soon)

You can check out an example of [a published view here](https://insert-dev.dashibase.com/t/9cf9616d-bea5-40af-abaa-6112e010e1a7). The super secret password is `supatable`.

As promised, this is also free to use. Just [sign up](https://dashibase.com/view) or [log in](https://insert.dashibase.com/) to your existing account to get started. 

Quick notes:

1. Eventually you will be able to build your dashboards via such an interface.
2. We are figuring out the open-source version of this. Any contributions will be appreciated!

## Improvements

- The options menu in Dashibase Insert used to be cut off at the top. This has been fixed. 
- Long text blocks for your published forms now show at least three lines even when there is no text. It used to be just one line.
