![Rolling out a beta site for testing](../assets/beta.png)

## Beta site is up!

We will be deploying new features and updates to our beta site a week before releasing them to our main app.
For anyone who is interested in helping us test new features, you can try them out by logging onto the beta site (https://beta.dashibase.com) instead of the main site (https://app.dashibase.com).

## Fixes and improvements (in beta)
- A preview mode to see what your dashboard looks like.
- Separate save and deploy buttons.
  - Saving will save your changes but not deploy them to your live dashboard.
  - Deploying updates your live dashboard.
- The overall site may feel faster because we have implemented some fixes under the hood.

As mentioned, these improvements will be released on the beta site for a week where we will test them extensively before rolling them out onto the main site. To anyone who intends to try out the beta site - thank you and be sure to let us know if you find any bugs!
