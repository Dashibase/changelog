![Major UI revamp and more](../assets/dawn.png)

## Modern app UI

The apps you build with Dashibase will have a more modern UI. We consulted several UIUX and product designer friends and pored over numerous articles to improve the look and feel of dashboards created with Dashibase. This included small (yet big) details: 

- What is a good way to present data on cards? 
- What should the hover effect on different elements be? 
- What shades and contrasts are good for dark mode? 

(Did you know pure black looks jarring because nothing, in reality, is pure black?)

On that note, weâ€™re always collecting feature requests and suggestions. Let us know!

## Improved Dashibase experience

The current Dashibase app was an MVP we coded up in four days. The new UI will make it easier and faster to build and edit your apps. A few highlights:

- No need to manually type your Supabase tables and column IDs (and can avoid typos). Dashibase will fetch them for you, and you can select them via a dropdown.
- You can edit your attributes on the attributes table directly, saving you extra clicks.
- An in-page resizable preview while you are editing your app.
- Once you are familiar with Dashibase and want to go even faster, you can edit your apps by directly updating the underlying JSON.

## New website

In line with our product update, we have also updated [our website](https://dashibase.com/). We value craftsmanship a lot and look up to companies like Linear, The Browser Company, Superhuman, and Stripe. Besides making a great product, we also push ourselves to ship great-looking websites.

We added a demo on our homepage so that visitors can get to experience Dashibase immediately. The copy on the website is inspired by conversations with our early users.

## Fixes and improvements

Editing

- You can now set the URL of each page in your dashboard.
- You can also set the ID and user columns for each page. We used to hardcode them as "id" and "user". 
- Items now have a primary attribute, which is the first attribute. The primary attribute is displayed more prominently on cards and tables.
- You can hide attributes that you do not want to show on the cards or tables. They are still viewable when viewing the particular item.

Using your dashboard

- Your end-users can now filter items by date (after, on, or before a certain date).
- They can also filter items by boolean (true or false).

Styling
  
- Cards are meant for seeing information at a quick glance. Therefore, cards are now narrower so that your end-users can see up to four cards per row.
- Single select and boolean attributes now have additional styling to make them more scannable.
- We finetuned the shades for dark mode so that it is easier on the eye and usable in low-light settings.
- We tidied up the side panel: The profile photo is in the lower-left corner, the email address is hidden, and the logout button for your end users is now hidden behind their profile photo.
