![Major UI revamp and more](../assets/dawn.png)

## Modern app UI

The apps you build with Dashibase will have a more modern UI. We consulted several UIUX and product designer friends and pored over numerous articles to improve the look and feel of dashboards created with Dashibase. This included small (yet big) details: 

- What is a good way to present data on cards? 
- What should the hover effect on different elements be? 
- What shades and contrasts are good for dark mode and WCAG-compliant?

(Did you know pure black looks jarring because nothing, in reality, is pure black?)

On that note, weâ€™re always collecting feature requests and suggestions. Let us know!

## Improved Dashibase experience

The current Dashibase app was an MVP we coded up in four days. The new UI will make it easier and faster to build and edit your apps. A few highlights:

- No need to manually type your Supabase tables and column IDs (and can avoid typos). Dashibase will fetch them for you, and you can select them via a dropdown.
- You can edit your attributes on the attributes table directly, saving you extra clicks.
- An in-page resizable preview while you are editing your app. This can still be opened in a separate tab or window, which is now hot reloading.
- Once you are familiar with Dashibase and want to go even faster, you can edit your apps by directly updating the underlying JSON.

## New website

In line with our product update, we have also updated [our website](https://dashibase.com/). We value craftsmanship a lot and look up to companies like Linear, The Browser Company, Superhuman, and Stripe. Besides making a great product, we also push ourselves to ship great-looking websites.

We added a demo on our homepage so that visitors can get to experience Dashibase immediately. The copy on the website is inspired by conversations with our early users.

## Fixes and improvements

Editing

- You can now customize the URL of each page in your dashboard. If you are using the open-source repository, this can be configured via the `Page.page_id` attribute.
- You can set the ID and user columns for each page. These were previously hardcoded as "id" and "user". These can also be configured via `Page.id_col` and `Page.user_col` in the open-source config.
- You can hide attributes that you do not want to show on the cards or tables. They are still viewable when viewing the particular item. If you are using the open-source repository, this can be configured via the `Attribute.hidden` flag.

Using your dashboard

- The first attribute for each page is now displayed more prominently on cards and tables.
- Your end-users can now filter on date attributes (after, on, or before a certain date).
- They can also filter on boolean attributes (true or false).
- Empty list or card pages now say "No rows/cards found"

Styling
  
- Cards are meant for seeing information at a quick glance. Therefore, cards are now narrower so that your end-users can see up to four cards per row.
- Single select and boolean attributes now have additional styling to make them more scannable.
- We finetuned the shades for dark mode so that it is easier on the eye and usable in low-light settings.
- We tidied up the side panel: The avatar is in the lower-left corner, the email address is hidden, and the logout button for your end users is now tucked behind the avatar.

Bug fixes

- Fix bug where default values for enum and boolean attributes were not saved.
- Fix bug where user is sometimes still logged in when auth token is expired, which resulted in empty dashboards.
